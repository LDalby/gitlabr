## Setup a local development environment

If you want to run the test suite locally, you need to setup a Gitlab instance for testing. Then, in the file `tests/environment.yml` configuration variables are recorded about how to connect to the gitlab instance. [tests/environment.yml.example](tests/environment.yml.example) contains an example configuration for a server that is, however, not publicly available for a testing.

## How to create a test server

The gitlab test suite expects certain entities (user, project, files) to be present in the test server. Here is how to setup a test server:

- install & make gitlab instance reachable at a certain address (The easiest way is to use the a docker image of the gitlab version of interest or use https://gitlab.com)
- create a user
  + Add your username in environment.yml as GITLABR_TEST_LOGIN
  + Add your user ID in environment.yml as GITLABR_TEST_LOGIN_ID (numeric)
    + Go to your profile (like https://gitlab.com/profile) and find your User ID
  + Add your user password in environment.yml as GITLABR_TEST_PASSWORD
- generate a private access token for the user for the complete API
  + For instance on Gitlab.com: https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens
  + Add in the environment.yml or environment variables as "GITLABR_TEST_TOKEN"
- create a project called `testor`, owned by the user, and containing a README.md file
  + New Project > Initialize with a README
  + Add this name in the environment.yml as variable named "GITLABR_TEST_PROJECT_NAME"
- get the ID of the project and note it in the environment.yml as variable named 'GITLABR_TEST_PROJECT_ID'
  + Project Overview > Details
  + The Project ID is under the name of your project
- give it a CI file that writes to a "test.txt" file
- create an issue #1 with a comment
  + Issues > List > New issue
  + Add title and description > Open
  + Add comment
- Comment on a commit and note its SHA1 in the environment.yml as variable named 'COMMENTED_COMMIT'
  + Repository > Commits
  + Click on one commit
  + Write a comment > Comment
  + Find the <SHA1> of the commit
- Create a branch named "for-tests"

- On your computer:
  + Clone the repository
    + Rstudio > New project > Version control > git 
    + Or git clone https://.....testor.git
  + Copy the content of "dev/testor" in the directory
    + It contains a R package with CI for tests
  + Send to the _master_ on the server
  
  
### How to run the test suite

When the test server is set up as described above tests can be run with the following R code that loads the recorded environment variables and runs the test code:

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(yaml)
do.call(Sys.setenv, yaml.load_file("tests/environment.yml")) ## load test environment variables
test() ## run tests
```

### API version

The test suite is intended for use with Gitlab API v4, compatibility with API v3 is no longer maintained. Still, you can switch to run the tests against API v3, by setting the environment variable `GITLABR_TEST_API_VERSION` to value `v3`. Note that API v3 is not present in recent gitlab versions!
